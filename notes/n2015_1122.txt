I got my first demo to run.

The JavaScript is here:

https://github.com/danbikle/app29/blob/master/demo11.html

To run the JS I load this URL:

http://app29.herokuapp.com/demo11.html

Then I right-click Inspect-Element.

In that UI I operate the debugger to see the JS run.

The UI looks like this image:
