~/app29/README.md

This repo contains some demos which I wrote to connect my mind to the convnet.js API.

To get started I did this:

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs.git cnet

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/danbikle/app29.git
cd app29
git checkout -b mybranch
cat ~/cnet/src/*.js > convnet.js
